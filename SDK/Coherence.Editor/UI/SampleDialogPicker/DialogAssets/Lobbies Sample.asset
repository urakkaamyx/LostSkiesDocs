  Description: 'A Canvas UI Prefab to be able to browse, create and join Lobbies
    hosted in the coherence Cloud.


    Lobbies are a way to do matchmaking between
    players for your game. They require a coherence Cloud account and having the
    Persistent Accounts feature enabled in the Game Services section of your coherence
    Dashboard.


    When you click Add To Scene, the Sample will be imported to
    your project, and the prefab will be instanced in the active Scene.'
