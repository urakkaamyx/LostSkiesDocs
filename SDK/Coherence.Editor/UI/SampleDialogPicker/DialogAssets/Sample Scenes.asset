  Description: "The absolute simplest way to familiarize yourself with the basics
    of coherence.\n\nYou can import these self-contained Scenes directly into your
    existing Unity project. The included Scenes cover:\n\n\u2022 Synchronizing a
    capsule movement.\n\u2022 How to distribute authority of entities across the
    current network session.\n\u2022 Synchronizing rigidbodies in a very simple physics
    simulation.\n\u2022 How to use entity persistence.\n\u2022 Spawning each joining
    player in a different spawn point.\n\u2022 Using LiveQueries to specify which
    area of the networked world to sync.\n\nScenes are numbered in ascending difficulty,
    so we recommend starting with the 1_CharacterMovement Scene and work it up from
    there."
