  Description: "A sample integration for the PlayFab Party Transport and coherence
    networking for player-hosted servers.\n\nThe PlayFab Integration is using a combination
    of the PlayFab relay servers and an implementation of ICoherenceRelay to enable
    PlayFab users to connect and play with each other while avoiding NAT issues.
    The ICoherenceRelay implementation allows for users to connect to the hosting
    client through PlayFab, and have the client forward their data packets to the
    user-hosted Replication Server.\n\nPortions of this program \xA9 2023 Microsoft
