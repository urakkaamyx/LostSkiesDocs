  Description: "A sample integration of the EOS P2P Relay and coherence networking
    for player-hosted servers.\n\nThe EOS Integration is using a combination of the
    Epic Online Services relay servers and an implementation of ICoherenceRelay to
    enable Epic Online Services users to connect and play with each other while avoiding
    NAT issues. The ICoherenceRelay implementation allows for users to connect to
    the hosting client through Epic Online Services, and have the client forward
    their data packets to the user-hosted Replication Server.\r"
