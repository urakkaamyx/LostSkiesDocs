  Description: "A sample integration for the Steam P2P Relay and coherence networking
    for player-hosted servers.\n\nThe Steam Integration is using a combination of
    the Steam relay servers and an implementation of ICoherenceRelay to enable Steam
    users to connect and play with each other while avoiding NAT issues. The ICoherenceRelay
    implementation allows for users to connect to the hosting client through Steam,
    and have the client forward their data packets to the user-hosted Replication
    Server.\n\n\xA92023 Valve Corporation. Steam and the Steam logo are trademarks
    and/or registered trademarks of Valve Corporation in the U.S. and/or other countries."
