        //
        // 1. Update the CurrentVersion by incrementing by 1.

        //    where the variable name is descriptive of the change with a comment about the change.

        //    For example, if the initial state of this file is:
        //
        //    const uint CurrentVersion = 1;
        //
        //    And we're adding a new floating origin optimization that is protocol
        //    breaking, then the new state of this file would be:
        //
        //    const uint uint CurrentVersion = 2;
        //    const uint uint FloatingOriginOptimization = 2; // Added new field to the FO component.
        //
        //    Only the CurrentVersion should change and only new constants are added, we should
        //    never change the value of the added constants.
